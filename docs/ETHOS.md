# Project Ethos

The guiding philosophy and strategic vision for my-family. For the phased feature plan and success factors, see [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md).

## Vision Statement

A premier self-hosted genealogy platform that combines **research rigor** with **engaging storytelling**, powered by a **git-inspired workflow** that treats family history research as the serious intellectual endeavor it deserves.

## Core Differentiators

### 1. Research Rigor (GPS-Compliant)
Align with the [Genealogical Proof Standard](https://bcgcertification.org/ethics-standards/) from the Board for Certification of Genealogists. Every fact should be tied to a source with proper citations, uncertain data clearly distinguished from established facts, and conflicting evidence surfaced and resolved through reasoned analysis.

### 2. Git-Inspired Workflow
Treat genealogy research like code — versioned, branched, collaborative. A full audit trail tracks who changed what, when, and why. Research hypotheses can be explored in branches without polluting the main tree, and proven findings merged back with review.

### 3. Bringing History to Life
Make ancestors feel like real people, not just names and dates. Interactive timelines, migration maps, oral history capture, and auto-generated narratives turn structured data into engaging stories with historical context.

### 4. Personalization & Extensibility
Your genealogy tool, your way. Customizable reports, fields, themes, dashboards, and a plugin architecture that enables community extensions.

### 5. Fun & Engaging
Research should be enjoyable, not a chore. Completeness scores, brick wall tracking, discovery feeds, achievements, and shareable spotlights keep researchers motivated.

## Strategic Principles

### 1. Nail the Basics First
Fast, reliable, easy to install, great import/export. No fancy features matter if the core is broken.

### 2. Dogfood Relentlessly
Use it for real research. Feel the pain points. The best features come from actual use.

### 3. Start Small, Ship Often
One polished feature beats ten half-done ones. Iterate based on real feedback.

### 4. Document as You Go
Good documentation is a feature. Lack of docs kills adoption.

### 5. Build in Public
Blog posts, progress updates, transparent roadmap. Community forms around openness.

### 6. Find Real Users Early
Five serious genealogists providing feedback beats a thousand GitHub stars.

### 7. Respect the Data
Genealogy data is irreplaceable. Never lose it, never lock it in, never corrupt it.

### 8. Honor the Craft
Genealogy is a scholarly discipline. Build tools worthy of serious researchers.

## Inspirations

- **TNG** - Comprehensive feature set, proven in the community
- **Ancestry.com** - Hints, ThruLines, engagement features
- **Git/GitHub** - Version control, branching, collaboration model
- **Evidence Explained** - Citation standards and methodology
- **Genealogical Proof Standard** - Research rigor framework

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Vendor lock-in** - Data must always be exportable
- **Feature bloat** - Do fewer things well
- **Complexity for its own sake** - Simple by default, powerful when needed
- **Ignoring standards** - GEDCOM compliance matters
- **Desktop-only thinking** - Mobile and offline are first-class
- **Developer-centric UX** - Build for genealogists, not programmers
